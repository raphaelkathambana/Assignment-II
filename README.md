**Preliminaries**

This is an individual assignment. We assume that you already know how to set up a localhost server(s): & MySQL database and Apache web servers.

If not, your instructor will assist you to set it up.

In this lab, we will learn how to use **Object Orientated PHP** by creating a form, that collects information from a user, which is then stores it in a database as well as reads that information from a database.

**Our tasks will be:**

- Create a MySQL database.
- Create a table.
- Create a form in PHP.
- Connect to the database using OOP & PDO
- Store to a database
- Read from a database.

The objective of this lab is to make clear the concepts of object-oriented PHP and databases.

- Classes and objects
- Interfaces
- Function and
- Databases

You will use a version control application (like GitHub). Invite your instructor to your repository using benjamin.mundama@strathmore.edu for him to access and assess your progress.
